Activity Sampling
=================

The application periodically asks the user for his current activity and creates
a log of his activities per day. In the case of demand, the current activity can
be confirmed with just one click or, alternatively, another activity can be
started or continued.

*   Read last activities from log file and show in dialog.
*   Write user acceptance tests.

*   Rotation activity log as CSV files.
*   Publish to App Store.
